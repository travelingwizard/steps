The magician vigorously shakes the carpet or cloth and then makes a Spellcasting (7) test. If successful, the material animates, floating several inches above the ground. The base carrying capacity of the carpet is 200 pounds. The carpet has Physical and Mystic Defenses equal to the caster and if the carpet takes damage equal to or in excess of its Death Rating (30), the spell ends. The magician can verbally control the carpet, requiring his concentration. He may turn over command of the carpet to another character, who may verbally command it the same way. The magician may regain control of the carpet with a successful Spellcasting (7) test. The carpet is not intelligent and is easily confused, so commands issued to it must be simple, limited to a couple of words at best. The carpet normally flies a few inches above the ground at Movement Rate 16, but can fly as high as 100 yards if commanded to do so, rising 2 yards vertically for every 2 yards of horizontal movement. The magician may extend the duration to a year and a day by taking 2 Blood Magic Damage. This damage cannot be healed until the carpet is destroyed or the spell ends."},

After completing the circle, he touches the bones and makes a Spellcasting test against the spiritâs Mystic Defense.

It is not very intelligent and has limitations on the powers it can possess. The bone spiritâs powers are selected when the bone circle is created and may only have the following spirit powers: Aid Summoner, Confusion, Durability, Evil Eye, and Manifest. It cannot leave the bone circle, but will take physical action against anyone attempting to enter or already in the circle.\nSome spells, such as Grave Message (p.327) and Spirit Portal (p.341), require the use of a bone circle. A magician may have a number of active bone circles equal to his Spellcasting Rank.\nKicking away the bones and erasing the inscriptions is not sufficient to destroy  a bone circleâit just makes it more difficult to see the circleâs outline and therefore avoid disturbing the spirit that dwells there. A bone circle can be dispelled, but the magician must touch the circle to do so, risking assault from the spirit. The bone spirit will not harm its summoner, but cannot otherwise be controlled."},

A magician may attempt to cast spells on a target that he has astrally sensed, even if he cannot otherwise see the target.\nMagicians use this spell for many different reasons. It is often cast to make extended astral examinations less taxing. As with normal uses of Astral Sight, a magician using Astral Sense to view a thread item can sense the itemâs true pattern and would learn it was magical in nature.

A single spell supports 1,000 pounds of weight.\nThe magician may âbootstrapâ Levitate spells for improved effect. He may cast another spell on an existing platform to increase the weight the spell can support. The magician may also rise to the maximum height of the first Levitate spell and cast another Levitate spell (or spells) to move even higher. Bootstrapped spells must be managed carefullyâas soon as any lower-altitude Levitate spell ends, all higher-altitude Levitate spells also fail. Characters and objects on top of a platform when it fails suffer Falling damage (see the Gamemasterâs Guide) based on the distance fallen.\nMoving the platform up requires the magicianâs concentration, regardless of how many âbootstrappedâ spells he is currently manipulating. If he loses concentration, the platform automatically descends to the ground at 4 yards per round.\nThe magician must make a Spellcasting test if the number of characters or objects on a platform increases, for example, if another character jumps onto it.

The magician makes an Effect test against a Dispel Difficulty based on the Spell Circle. If successful, the spell leaves the targetâs matrix and appears in one of the casterâs matrices. The snatched spell remains in the magicianâs spell matrix until cast or replaced, depending on the spell.\nIf casting the snatched spell is beyond the magicianâs abilities (he does not have the proper Thread Weaving  talent or is not a high enough Circle), he may still cast it from the matrix as if it were cast from a grimoire which he has attuned (p. 252). Either way, the snatched spell vanishes from his spell matrix as soon as it is cast. If the magician is capable of casting the snatched spell, he may use it normally, in which case the spell remains in his spell matrix until replaced by another spell or erased by a Reattuning failure. If the snatched spell is unknown to the magician, he can attempt a Patterncraft test to learn the spell (see Learning Spells, p.251). If successful, he may spend the appropriate Legend Points to add the spell to his grimoire."},
